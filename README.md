# digitReadingNeuralNetwork
Classifies handwritten digits via a multi-layer perceptron neural network (only 1 layer of hidden nodes in this case). I.e. it looks at attribute vectors that represent written numbers and predicts which digit the vector corresponds to. For each vector it says "this is an X" where X is an element of {1, 4, 7, 8, 9}. General format of the run command: java HW4 <numHidden> <learnRate> <maxEpoch> <trainFile> <testFile>  where numHidden is the number of intermediate nodes in the network, learn rate is the constant alpha used to determine the rate at which the weights in the network are updated, maxEpoch bounds the number of runs through the primary loop in the algorithm, the trainFile specifies the attributes of the handwritten digits to train the network with (this data determines what the weights in the network are), and where the testFile is used to see how well the network was trained. An example run command: java HW4 5 0.01 100 train1.txt test1.txt
